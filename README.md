# timebot

Ive tried calendars.
Ive tried notebooks.
Ive tried timers and alarms.
Remembering to do recurring tasks like the chores is hard.

Lets try something new:
lets build tasks and chores as yaml files.
and from there we can generate calendars,
timers, automations, notifications,
or whatever else in one legible standard.

Or maybe its just an excuse to procrastinate more.
it can be two things.
